Recommender System<br/>
The sole purpose of this project is to develop a movie recommendation engine<br/><br/>
Features<br/>
First things first, the dataset contains information about 45,467 movies which is broken down into 24 data points. They include genres,
budget, id, overview, runtime, vote count, run time and much more. Now, what can we do with this dataset? It would be easier to say
what we can't do with this dataset! However, let's go through some of the key features.
Movies can be filtered based on ratings, genres, cast, crew, production company, release date. Actors profiles can be viewed.
Users can get personalised recommendations based on their likings. Movies can be rated on a scale of 1 to 10, they can be added
to watchlist, and users can also view how many people have rated a movie.
