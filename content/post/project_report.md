First things first, let me be honest. I’ve absolutely ‘zero’ prior knowledge in coding and I’ve not worked with Android. As a matter of fact, I've done my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering, and I have no idea about programming languages. I took this course because it is challenging and that I can learn something new. When I started this project, it was like Greek and Latin, and I couldn’t figure out anything. In fact, I gave up many times. Taking help from others and online communities helped me a lot.<br/><br>

The aim of this project is to build a movie recommendation engine, however, I was able to accomplish only the phase 1 of this project which is the search engine.
