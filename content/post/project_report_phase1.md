First things first, let me be honest. I’ve absolutely ‘zero’ prior knowledge in Data Mining and I’ve not worked with Android until I started doing this project. I took this course because it is challenging and that I can learn something new. I have to mention few people who helped me directly and indirectly in completing the Phase 1. Bhaskar Trivedi is the first person who shared the GitHub link of his code and that helped me a lot. Even my friend and fellow classmate Christo, taught me the basics of Android. Of course, I’ve not yet finished the Phase 1 as per the given requirements, but I’ve tried my level best to complete most of it.<br/><br/>
When I started this project, it was like Greek and Latin, and I couldn’t figure out anything. In fact, I gave up many times. Taking help from others and online communities helped me a lot. I started learning Android and began to create simple applications which display images and text. I’m not completely proficient in Java, but I can figure out what the code is about by looking at it. Again, one of my friend and fellow class mate, Vishnu(Pro in Java), helped me coding in Java. I’ve gone through some courses in learning portals like Udacity and Udemy, and also I referred websites like stackoverflow, stack exchange when I got stuck. However, as I told earlier, I did not finish the project completely. Maintaining a different server for the data set is the hardest part, and I couldn’t achieve this requirement in the given time. <br/><br/>
As of now, my Android App, which I named it as movieREC, retrieves the summary of a movie if we give movie title as input. And, the dataset is stored locally instead of being stored on a server. Also, I came to know that the app should also be able to retrieve movie title if we give any word from over view as input. I couldn’t add these features as of now, but if given some time I’m pretty confident that I can meet all the given requirements. Even though I couldn’t make the App all by myself, and I still couldn’t understand all the concepts involved, I can confidently say that I learned a lot in this process.
