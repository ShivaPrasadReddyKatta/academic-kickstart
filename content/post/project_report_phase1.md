First things first, let me be honest. I’ve absolutely ‘zero’ prior knowledge in Data Mining and I’ve not worked with Android until I started doing this project. I took this course because it is challenging and that I can learn something new. I have to mention few people who helped me directly and indirectly in completing the Phase 1. Bhaskar Trivedi is the first person who shared the GitHub link of his code and that helped me a lot. Even my friend and fellow classmate Christo, taught me the basics of Android. Of course, I’ve not yet finished the Phase 1 as per the given requirements, but I’ve tried my level best to complete most of it.
